                For native English speakers, remembering the form and pronunciation of Chinese characters can be hard.
                Solved is here to make it easier, more fun and more meaningful -- we tell the vivid stories and explain
                the clever rules behind the formation of these characters. This method, called radical breakdown, has
                been theoretically and experimentally shown to effective in learning Chinese characters by many studies.
                <br><br>
                Solved incorporates ancient wisdoms with modern technology. It is research-based, individualized,
                engaging, user-friendly, and free! Read more about the art and science behind it here.
